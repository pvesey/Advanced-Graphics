\Large\textbf{Assignment 3 - CareBright (10\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

This assignment is in conjunction with the CareBright project set in Design Studio 3.  The marks allocated to this subject are separate to the mark allocation in Design Studio 3.\\

In this assignment you are required to produce 4 photo realistic images of your design solution as developed for the CareBright project.\\

You may use the images developed in this subject as part of your Design Studio submission.\\

In order to complete this assignment, I suggest the following work-flow:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Model areas of interest in Revit
	\item Import Revit file provided into 3D Studio
	\item Carefully select camera locations for each of the 4 images.  Make sure that the camera scenes are appropriately lit, and detailed enough to communicate design intent.  
	\item Apply high quality, correctly scaled materials to the visible objects in each camera view
	\item Run several test renders before committing to the final render
	\item Run final quality renders with GI etc.
\end{itemize}
