\Large\textbf{Assignment 7 - Masterpiece (30\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

The concept of a masterpiece dates back hundreds of years.  A masterpiece is an object that demonstrates the skill and proficiency of its creator.  In this assignment you are going to demonstrate your mastery of Autodesk 3D Studio Max, and the Mental Ray rendering engine by creating or re-creating a single rendered image of a scene of your own creation, and a game engine version of the same scene. The scene is to be similar to those shown in Figures 1 to 5.\\

The key deliverables of this project are therefore:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single 3D Studio Max, Mental Ray Render
	\item Unity game engine deployment of scene
	\item Report on the creation of each of the above.
\end{enumerate}

This project will take a considerable amount of time to complete.  Final renders will take over 4 hours to produce.  Success in this project will require an immediate start and at least 4 hours per week in addition to class time.  \\

\textbf{Suggested Production Workflow}\\
Creation of images of the quality shown below requires planning and discipline in both time management and asset management.  I suggest you adopt a structured approach similar to that shown below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each component (asset) to be a separate 3DS file, XRefed into the 'Master' Scene.
	\item Create each asset fully, including all geometery and materials and run test renders to ensure each asset performs as expected
	\item Create an empty building model with a default material and light appropriately.  It is easier to light the scene when there are less objects within it.  
	\item Add the materials to the building scene.  Ensure all materials and lighting behave within expected parameters
	\item Populate the master scene with the building model and other assets and render.
	\item Once the model is complete, it can be imported into Unity via an FBX file.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Submission and Demonstration}\\

You are required to submit all assets and files used to create your scene.  This includes all materials, models, images, and other items generated.  Create a single zip file and upload to Moodle on or before the submission date.\\

You will present your render and demonstrate your game engine version to the class and other lecturing staff at a date and time as advised on Moodle.  All class members are required to attend the demonstrations.\\



\textbf{Factors that will be considered when marking}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Realism of images
	\item Lighting
	\item Materials
	\item Composition
	\item Render errors
	\item Polygon count
\end{itemize}
