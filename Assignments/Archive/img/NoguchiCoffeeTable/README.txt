Thank you for paying attention to model+model products.

1. INTRODUCTION

Model+model creates for you 3d models of high quality. Now you can easily add more details to your scenes and greatly save your time. Model+model also gives you the opportunity to choose whether to buy a single model or purchase a large number of models in one volume at a very attractive price. All our models available in different formats with all textures. 

2. HOW TO USE

We were working very hard to make all products simple to use. The name of free file contains the product number and some description. For example mpm_F01_vray.MAX means the free product number 1 prepared for use in *.max scenes with vray rendering system.  
Some models are provided in different materials. All available variations are showed on previews. To get a model with another material do the following: select this model, choose the material you want from the material library or *.mat file and assign it. Note that materials are available only for 3dsmax scenes with scanline or vray rendering system.
