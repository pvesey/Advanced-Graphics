\Large\textbf{Assignment 2 - Hotel Room Renders using VRay (15\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

This assignment is based on a simple hotel room design.  You have been provided with a 3DS Max model of the room which also includes 3 lights and 5 camera views.  You have also been provided with a pdf of the room design. \\
\\
In this assignment you are required to improve the interior design of the space and to create 5 photo-realistic renders using VRay. You may use materials and assets from sources of your own choosing; however you must include a text file in the `import' that contains details of where you sources the assets.\\
\\
Your key deliverables are 5 high quality renders of the interior space. Three or four images are to be of the main bedroom space, and one or two images are to be of the en-suite bathroom.\\
\\
To assist you in this assignment, I suggest the following work-flow:\\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Examine the design drawings and decide on your improvements.
	\item Source 3DS files from TurboSquid, Polantis or similar as necessary.
	\item Import, scale and place your objects and run test renders.
	\item Create and modify materials as necessary.
	\item Run numerous test renders and add additional lights as necessary for the design and illumination of the space
	\item Create final renders.
\end{enumerate}
