\Large\textbf{Limerick Outing (5\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

We are going to do three things on Tuesday the 24th of November.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Take a sequence of Images of Limerick (5\%)
	\item Purchase an object to model in 3DS (Pocket Size from Charity Shop)
	\item Have lunch in Marco Polo (Optional)
\end{enumerate}

The first item is the only one that requires clarification.  The objective is to create an interesting set of 10 images on one of the following themes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Irish Climate
	\item Old \& New
	\item City Life
	\item Visual Noise
	\item Pattern, Texture and Harmony
	\item Clash - who let this happen?
	\item Cultural Diversity
	\item The Wall
\end{enumerate}

You are to organize yourselves into pairs.  Each pair will be assigned a theme to work with.  You are given free range in terms of location, but you must \textbf{be at the SVP shop on Thomas Street at 11:30}\\

Your images must be consistent with the theme provided.  Your images will be judged on how well they fit the theme, framing, composition, etc.  Take your time when setting up, and creating these images; ensure there is a sequence and story to them.\\

Try to avoid 'documentary' images and eye level images.\\

When we return to class, each pair will present their images for critique.
