\Large\textbf{Assignment 3 - Creating Materials (5\%)}\\
\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you are going to create three materials from scratch.  You are required to model a leather material, a ceramic material, and a finished tile material.  In order to do this you will have to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify bitmaps suitable for the creation of each material
	\item Create diffuse, normal, and specular maps from your image selection.  Please note that you can 'blend' bitmaps to create your initial diffuse map
	\item Select an appropriate material algorithm for each material, such as Blinn, Phong, etc.
	\item Apply each material to an object of your choice.  Ensure you choose an object that will showcase your material in the best possible manner.
	\item Render each of the objects using the photography studio template.
\end{enumerate}

Submission is to be a zip file containing the model geometry, materials, and rendered images.\\

Upload your model to Moodle upon completion.
