No deviation from this specification is allowed without prior approval.  In order to complete this assignment, you will be required to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Model the cup and saucer using the a number of modifiers.  In particular you will have to use (but not limited to) the lath modifier and the shell modifier.
	\item You will have to undertake a number of manipulations of points, edges and faces to create the cup handle
	\item You may use the Autodesk materials that ship with 3DS, however you must use at least two materials on each object.

\end{enumerate}

Submission is to be a zip file containing the model geometry, materials, and rendered images.\\
